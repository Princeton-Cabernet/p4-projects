# Tofino implementation of TCP RTT Measurement

This directory hosts P4 implementation of TCP RTT measurement running on the Barefoot Tofino programmable switch. 

We used register arrays to implement a hash table, with each entry saving a record for an outgoing TCP packet with its expected acknowledgment number and a timestamp. When the incoming ACK packet arrived, we fetch the entry and calculate the time difference. The entries in the table are *lazily expired*: they are consider expired when the timestamp is too old, but only overwritten upon hash collisions.

For more details, please refer to our paper: [Measuring TCP Round-Trip Time in the Data Plane](#) (To appear in SIGCOMM'20 SPIN workshop).

The current version of the implementation posted here uses a two-stage hash table.

### Setup

The P4 program receives mirrored bi-directional traffic and automatically guesses if a packet is a data packet or ACK response, based on packet size. For data packet, no output will be given. For ACK packet, if it matched with an earlier record, we successfully produce a RTT sample, and it will be written in the payload section of the output report.

The output report is in IPv4+UDP format, with the original packet appended after the report.

### Compiling

To compile, run `bf-p4c p4src/RTT.p4`.
Please use `bf-p4c` version 9.1.0 or higher to compile the program.
